This starter project was generated using the [Vite with TypeScript and React](https://vite.dev/guide/#scaffolding-your-first-vite-project) starter template.

It has the following added dependencies:

## Getting started

Install the dependencies by running the following command: 

```sh
npm install
```

## Running the app

Use the following command to run the local dev server, as well as `vite --open --port 3000`:
